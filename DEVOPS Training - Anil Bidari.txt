DEVOPS Training - Anil Bidari

SDN-Software-defined networking is an approach to computer networking that allows network administrators to programmatically initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open interfaces[1] and abstraction of lower-level functionality. SDN is meant to address the fact that the static architecture of traditional networks doesn't support the dynamic, scalable computing and storage needs of more modern computing environments such as data centers. This is done by decoupling or disassociating the system that makes decisions about where traffic is sent (the SDN controller, or control plane) from the underlying systems that forward traffic to the selected destination (the data plane).

Nuetron is an OVS
 - Has OVS agent
 - DHCP agent
 - L3 agent

Across Nodes - GRE Port tunnel switch - Data port - Tunneling data
within Nodes - Patch panel
Tap port - configured as DHCP for your server for every network/can be gateway too

Agile> moved to Devops
AGILE+Toolset = DEVOPS
DevOps>Micrososervices(breaking software into multople software modules), issues doesnt impact each other
Orcherstrating and Automating

JENKINS,Travis,CI,Xebialabs - Orchestrating tool - Like Project Manager, CI/CD tools- Continous Integration/Continous Deployment
GITHUB/BITBUCKET - Public Clouds for Version control - Public and Private repositories
SONARQUBE/HP Fortify - Continous Inspection
MAVEN,ANT,Selenium,Cucumber - Build/Test tools
Chef/Puppet, Ansible - Configuration Managment
NewRelic/AppDynamics - Logging tools
Docker - Container



Github - repository of developer modules
Jenkins(CI tool) polls Github and consolidates
Trigger Job to Slave node(mvn package and deploy)
(Maven)mvn compile
mvn package
configure
Install tomcat
Deploy and give URL to you
